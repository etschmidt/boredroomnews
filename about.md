Boredroom News was founded in July, 1984, by two brothers, Warren Buffet and Milton Friedman, deep in the heart of Michigan's Upper Penninsula 
Warren and Milty (as he liked to be called) grew up with a resounding passion for business news, and after studying Economics at the University of Stockholm, Iowa, they returned to the UP to help run their father's caribou farm. Unfortunately, their father dies in his sleep duing a caribou stampped, the brothers sold the farm and moved to New York City, to start their very own business newspaper.

After that paper failed, they sold crack in the inner city until they had enough to buy the Boredroom News
