Boredroom News was founded in July, 1984, by two brothers, Warren and Milton. Born in the heart of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Warren and Milty (as he liked to be called) grew up with a resounding passion for business news. After studying Economics at the University of Phoenix Online, they returned to help run their father’s caribou farm. Unfortunately, after their father died in his sleep during a caribou stampede, the brothers sold the farm and moved to New York City to start their very own business newspaper.

After that paper failed, they sold crack in the inner city until they had enough money to buy a small pornography magazine, which eventually became Boredroom News.
