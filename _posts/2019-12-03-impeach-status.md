WASHINGTON, D.C. - In an historic first for a president with [sharp history](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-administration-supreme-court-transgender-workers_n_5d57254be4b056fafd0be1aa) of narrowing definitions of workplace discrimination, President Trump has asked the Office of Personnel Management to add 'Impeachment Status and/or Conviction' to federally protected employment classes.

As Congressional Democrats begin impeachment proceedings against the president, Mr. Trump now wants to enshrine the rights of all federal employees to keep their jobs, just in case any of them happen to be convicted by the United States Senate of "high crimes or misdemeanors" against the interests of the nation. Currently, the Office of Personnel management, the independent agency that oversees the U.S. civilian government workforce, currently cannot treat employees differently on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

"This is good step for people in the government, the best people, like me, smart people," President Trump declared this morning from the Oval Office as his team has refused to participate so far in the impeachment proceeding. "this historic executive order, that I made, so you know it's good because I'm smart, will keep very good people, I don't know who, in the jobs they were elected to do, even if they've been convicted by Congress of whatever."
