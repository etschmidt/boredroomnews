BURBANK, CA - The new streaming service, hailed by many as "revolutionary," has made the bold decision to limit its entire catalog to the 1975 period drama, _Barry Lyndon_. Because 3-hour epic cannot be rewound, paused, or stopped at any time, the move has surprised many, especially those users who signed up for the $47-per-month platform who expected the legendary director's more popular works. Industry experts, however, have almost unanimously claimed that Kubrick+ is "the only digital media service consumers will need in the future."
