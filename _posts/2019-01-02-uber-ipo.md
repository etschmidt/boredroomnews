SAN FRANCISCO - Having filed it's S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the last days of 2018, the ride-hailing service Uber is expected to launch it's [initial public offering](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ipo-hungry-investors-look-to-have-their-moment-in-2019-11546189200) early in 2019. Although the tech giant pulled in just under $3 billion in revenues last quarter, they face stiff competition in the market and are beginning to temper the expectations of investors. 

Uber has made many drastic [course-corrections](https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/06/technology/business/uber-fires-sexual-harassment/index.html) in their company culture since a former engineer, Susan Fowler, [posted on her blog](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) about the rampant sexual misconduct pervasive throughout the firm known for it's hard-charging corporate environment. Now, however, the pendulum is swinging back towards allowing male employees license to harass female colleagues with little repercussion as the public takes a closer look at the company. 

"Look, we've got more than half the market" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi explains, "but some investors are wary of where we can expand; we're not actually and different or better than [Lyft](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyft-picks-underwriters-for-ipo-in-2019-1539707979). We don't want to get caught not living up to expectations, so we're sending a clear message that Uber is pretty fucked-up at the moment." Mr. Khosrowshahi hopes that the sexual misconduct concerns that will arise will be conflated with the troubling financial outlook. Once Uber initiates, again, a pro forma spate of firing for sexual harassments, such revitalization will overshadow anything else.

"We just want to get everybody on the same page early; I mean, butt-touching has always been central to the employee experience and now we have an excuse to touch butts to manipulate investors as well. What's more Uber than that?"
