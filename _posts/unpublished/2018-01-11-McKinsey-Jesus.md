JERUSALEM - Reports of bribes to [Ukrainian oligarchs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/world/mckinsey-bribes-boeing-firtash-extradition.html), helping China build [internment camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/world/asia/mckinsey-china-russia.html), siphoning [public funds](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/world/africa/mckinsey-south-africa-eskom.html) in South Africa; 2018 was a hard year for McKinsey & Company in the press. However, Boredroom News has uncovered new documents that attest before the global management consulting company's scandal in [Saudi Arabia](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/mckinsey-saudi-arabia-consulting-scandal.html) the firm had a history of similar activity in the region.

The prestigious consultancy identified certain Saudis who opposed government policies on the social platform Twitter. Those at the top of the list were soon arrested and imprisoned by authorities in a recent crackdown on citizens and journalists alike. Wile shocking to learn that an American company had enabled anti-democratic activity in a country with strained diplomatic ties, the work is not new to the region or McKinsey. Around 2000 years ago the firm had also been employed by the governor of Occupied Judea to quell perceived unrest.

Internal Powerpoint slides show that a prominent dissident at the time, Yeshua ben Yousef, a young cleric here in Jerusalem, had been identified by McKinsey consultants as a linchpin in the local government's plan to maintain control of the region. The chief administrative official at the time, Pontius Pilate had been initially wary of such extreme measures, those familiar with his office say. It had only been at the behest of Joseph Caiaphas, a McKinsey partner for the Middle East office, that Mr. Pilate had condemned Mr. ben Yousef.

When reached for comment, Lucy Sullivan, a spokesperson for McKinsey, said that the firm could not offer specifics on the millennia-old engagement with the provincial Roman Empire. Ms. Sullivan has assured Boredroom News that "any loss of life is deeply regrettable... [however] there are credible reports that Yoshua Ben Yousef was a known sorcerer and troublemaker and that both Mr. Pilate as well as McKinsey & Company were 'innocent of that man's blood.'"
