ATLANTA, GA - Maybe the perfect topping on a "mountain of meat" really is a secure, decentralized currency; at least that's what Arby's ([ARBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WEN/)) is counting on with the launch of its newest line of roast beef and blockchain sandwiches.

Many fast-food connoisseurs remain skeptical of what they see as a brash move to capitalize on the financial technology trend, but company officials are determined to re-invent the meat purveyors as the next generation of casual dining. "We're not really sure what the 'blockedchain' [sic] is," admits CEO Paul Brown, "but we do know that many consumers are more interested in crypto-money than in soggy cold cuts, so it's probably time to hop on the hype train." Brown has been the driving-force in [revitalizing fast-food brands](https://www.businessinsider.com/arbys-buffalo-wild-wings-paul-brown-asks-employees-for-advice-2018-2) but acknowledges that mountains of meat can only be pricing before the whole industry embraces a radical paradigm shift. "We have the meats - that's no question - now we just need to capitalize on the market trend towards decentralized financial services; it's really an adjacent industry when you think about it."

As Arny's begins it's roll-out of the Roast Beef & Cheddar with Extra Blockchain in select cities, the first few consumers were indeed impressed by he flavoring of decentralized ledger technology. "The strong cheddar taste I already love goes great with the Etherium baked right in," proclaims Sam Guncler of Des Moines, Iowa, "And I'm really looking forward to what they're doing with Ripple ([XRP](https://www.coinbase.com/price/ripple)) this summer."

Arby's planned initial coin offering is imminent as soon as their chief technology officer can figure out how to unlock his Gmail account.
