GREENSBORO, NC - Despite a fervent marketing push across social media channels, recent inessential oils startup Scentique is struggling to meet debt obligations and stay afloat. Founded on the heels of more successful multi-level marketing players such as [doTERRA](https://www.doterra.com/US/en) and [ItWorks!](https://www.itworks.us.com/), Scentique specializes in concentrated oils that have zero benefits to both humans as well as the plants and herbs from which they are extracted. Surprisingly, Scentique executives are scrambling to turnaround the business.

Diamond ELite Oils Consultant KandiLynn Gorney, otherwise unemployed mother of two, says she prepares her downstream clients with everything they need to succeed, "We've got a foolproof script,"

> Heyy gurl🙋! It's been a while since high school lol😎. what r u doing these days😍😍? [wait for response] that's grr8, Hun!🙌 how would u liek to be a complete bossbabe💪💪 and start ur own business💲💵? [they'll say yes] I have some amazing🌺 oils that don't do much💩 but if you can sell them to distant aquaintences on facebook😜, then you can make at least $20💵 a month! that's enough for two more bottles 🙌. Can I put you down for three cases to join our team🙏? 😻🌈✨✨

"Anyone with two years of failed community college and family members' credit card should be jumping on this opportunity," Ms. Gorney says, "if I still had custody of my kids, I'd be able to raise them right with all my oil money; I'm basically J.R. Ewing."

But many potential customers/employees/victims are skeptical. "I was in algebra with KandiLynn ten years ago," explains Melissa Donner, 28, "I guess she didn't pay much attention, because I'm certainly not going to leave my law practice to sell watery Glade Plug-ins to recovering meth addicts; that math just doesn't add up."

Scentique's Chief Executive Officer and sole profitable vendor, Carl Vortich, is not available to provide a comment for this story, according to the U.S. Department of Prisons, Tucson, where he is serving a slightly-unrelated sentence for wire fraud.
