Mr. Harner, 36, a portfolio manager at Oaktree Capital Management ([OAK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OAK)), hopes that he can meet women in the city so distraught that most men would not risk a relationship.

"When I started in the industry, traditional emotional debt markets were all the rage," explains Mr. Harner, "but soon enough the Lana Del Rey concerts and Ben & Jerry scenes were drying up." Dating market makers soon found value in the self-help section The Strand bookstore, but Harner and others continued to make even riskier investments in the emerging markets of eating disorder and substance abuse support groups.
