NEW YORK CITY -- A 205-year-old can of Black Label Mountain Dew became the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold at auction, fetching $1,580,000. Sotheby's announced on Monday that the can, which accompanied Napoleon into exile on St. Helena in his personal supply, shattered the previous record set by a rare 3-liter (known as “large format”) bottle of Açaí Fresca in 1996. 

Mountain Dew Black Label was defined by its dark berry flavor, being crafted with herbal bitters and real sugar. Adding to the value of the bottles sold Saturday was its ownership or “provenance;” The former French Emperor reported acquired a taste for the exotic beverage during military campaigns in Spain in 1803 and carried similar cans across Europe as his exploits unfolded.

Sotheby’s lot catalog described the 1815 vintage as “concentrated with bold, kick-ass confidence — a soda ready to cum in your mouth with flavor.”

"The new world record established in today’s sale is further proof that Napoleon really knew how to fuckin' Do the Dew," said Jamie Ritchie, worldwide head of Sotheby’s Soda and Snacks division. 

The winner of the auction, who wished to remain anonymous, reportedly consumed his prize accompanied by a fine meal of Wendy's chicken tenders.
