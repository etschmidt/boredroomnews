NEW YORK CITY - Columbia University announced that this year's Pulitzer Prize Board will consider a new category, Excellence in Bojack Horseman Thinkpiece Writing. Steve Coll, Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, hails the new category as sign in the ever-changing media landscape and an advancement in superficial self-reflection prompted by cartoons. 

Rated on overt empathy for severe depression, knowledge of obscure Los Angeles references, and an appreciation for whimsical sight gags, the inaugeral prize comes at a boomtime of Bojack content as the series awaits the second half of its final season on Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nflx).

The inclusion of Bojack Horseman Thinkpiece Writing has indeed riled some of journalism's old guard, who insist that the subject matter is neither as important nor expansive as traditional categories like Investigative or general Editorial Writing. However, Netflix who has also irked other [gatekeepers of Hollywoo](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/netflix-steven-spielberg-oscars-1203154092/) in recent weeks, issued the following response: "OK Boomer."
