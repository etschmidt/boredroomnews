NEW YORK CITY - Columbia University announced that this year's Pulitzer Prize Board will consider a new category, Excellence in Bojack Horseman Thinkpiece Writing. Steve Coll, Dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, hails the new category as sign in the ever-changing media landscape and an advancement in superficial self-reflection prompted by cartoons. 

Rated on overt empathy for severe depression, knowledge of obscure Los Angeles references, and an appreciation for whimsical sight gags, the inaugural prize comes at a boom-time of Bojack content as the series awaits the second half of its final season on Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nflx). The competition for the hottest take on BoJackâ€™s broken beauty is, however, fierce. Top contenders include "Bojack is my (nob-appropriative) spirit animal" by [The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/), an insightful reflection of how everyone's is sad sometimes, and "We Binged Season 5 on Ayahuasca and Here's What We Learned about Mr. Peanutbutter" by [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/), a daring, psychedelic foray into the soul of an emotionally-stunted golden retriever.
When asked for comment, an assistant to Bojack creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg said, "whatever article, listicle, or gif collection that most accurately captures the 'underlying metaphysical crisis of modernity' should clinch it."

The inclusion of Bojack Horseman Thinkpiece Writing has indeed riled some of journalism's old guard, who insist that the subject matter is neither as important nor expansive as traditional categories like Investigative or general Editorial Writing. However, Netflix who has also irked other [gatekeepers of Hollywoo](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/netflix-steven-spielberg-oscars-1203154092/) in recent weeks, issued the following response: "OK Boomer."
