BURBANK, CA -- Robert "Bob" Iger, longtime chief executive of [The Walt Disney Company](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS), announced yesterday that he would be steeping down effectively immediately to focus on his new role as accompanying banjoist on Splash Mountain.

Bob Chapek, who most recently led the company's theme parks division and brokered Iger's new position with Br'er Rabbit, will become the new CEO. 

Iger, 69, said it was time for him "to try new creative endeavors" and that he would "expand [his] personal brand into the music industry as an apprentice to all of the critter atop Disney's third most recognizable artificial mountain."
