PALO ALTO, CA -- Life often imitates art, and Elon Musk's breakthrough electric truck is no exception; careful observers have noticed that a strikingly similar vehicle can be seen in the Miranda Cosgrove teen sitcom, _iCarly_, which aired on the Disney Channel from 2008 to 2012.  

To many, the futuristic design of the  Cybertruck, which was unveiled last week to varied responses from Tesla critics and fans alike, is groundbreaking; however, iCarly aficionados know that Carly proposed such a truck in season four. In the episode "iDisrupt the Fossil Fuel Industry" Carly, and Sam, the co-host of her webshow-within-the-show, livestream the development of an eco-friendly, affordable pickup truck for a school project. The final product is clearly shown behind Ms. Cosgrove as they present it to the audience.

Representatives from Tesla were quick to respond as soon as these similarities surfaced. "Engineers, artists, and the supreme intelligence of Mr. Musk himself independently created the Cybertruck over the course of the last decade;" said Roland Burmington, a spokesperson for Tesla, wrote via e-mail. "Whatever resemblances that it may have to a children's TV show, that Elon really only watched periodically, is purely coincidental."

iCarly fans were little convinced, however, noting that among Carly Shaw's various schemes and adventures over the six seasons also included building a personal submarine to rescue the school's trapped soccer team and committing securities fraud via Twitter.
