PARMA, ITALY - Guido Barilla, the outspoken chairman of one of the market's leading past manufacturers, is in hot water once again for his [views on LGBT issues](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barilla-pasta-anti-gay_n_3995679). Effective this week, the company that he helms will stop all production of farfalle, commonly known as bow-tie or butterfly pasta, for being "pretty gay."

"Barilla wholeheartedly embraces its traditional European values," announced the chairman, "and therefore will shift focus to more family-friendly shapes like rigatoni, penne, and regular-thickness spaghetti; basically, straights-only." Mr. Barilla suggested that consumers who wish to purchase such 'abhorrent' shapes would be better served by "those tortellini-folders over at Trader Joe's"
