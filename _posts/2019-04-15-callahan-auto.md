SANDUSKY, OH - A shocking week for Callahan Auto Parts came to a fortunate close today as new Chief Executive Thomas Callahan III successfully defended the firm from Chicago rival, Zalinsky Industries. Earlier reports that Zalinsky would gain a controlling stake in the Ohio auto parts factory seem to be premature, as legal complications have stayed the sale of shares and Raymond Zalinsky has since publicly announced a purchase order from Callahan for 500,000 brake pads. 

Callahan Auto bet big last year on their new line of brake pads, leveraging high short-term debt to develop the new dedicated facility. However, the recent passing of beloved CEO Thomas "Big Tom" Callahan Jr. cast doubt on the firm's ability to sell the new line throughout the Midwest. However, the young Mr. Callahan has been able to reassure his hesitant financiers through a flurry of sales to key regional distributors in recent months. Industry experts credit this last-minute effort for saving the autonomy of the Callahan brand as well as over 500 jobs in the Sandusky, Ohio, manufacturing plant. 

Citing a genuine devotion to "the American Working Man," Mr. Zalinsky stands by his purchase order and partnership with Callahan Auto despite losing the bid for the company as whole. In related news, the late Mr. Callahan's widow, Beverly Barrish, as well as her alleged husband, Paul Barrish, have been arrested and face multiple counts of mail and wire fraud in New Mexico, Colorado, and Ohio.
