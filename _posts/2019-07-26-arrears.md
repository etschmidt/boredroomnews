DAYTONA BEACH, FL - The 2008 housing bubble devastated few regions more than the Florida coast, but thankfully one startup has set aim for revitalizing the area. The real estate technology company Arrears is the newest way for ordinary people to local homes that have been foreclosed by banks and turn them into an adult entertainment franchise.

Arrears is the leading tech-enabled direct home-foreclosure-to-booty-basement market experience. The company is revolutionizing the industry with an innovative network that streamlines the resident eviction process for adult-themed entrepreneurs, eliminating the traditional hassles for purveyors of exotic entertainment. The company touts itself as more than the latest property-tech darling, claiming that the app reduces the scourge of vacant houses and lots, brings much needed tourism dollars into the neighborhood, as well as provided immediate employment opportunities for the newly homeless.

Founded in 2015, the companyâ€™s leadership team has decades of real estate experience and collectively has patronized over 100,000 women, and quite a few men. Arrears is a privately held company, headquartered in Daytona Beach, with markets in Detroit, Reno, Scottsdale, and Newark.
