BURBANK, CA - The most anticipated launch of the streaming era hit a major snag this morning as Disney+, the vehicle by which  Disney ([DIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS)) plans to exclusively distribute their content. User who logged onto the service this morning did not find the vast library of Marvel, Star Wars, of animated favorites, but instead were met with only an array of short gifs from the 1973 feature cartoon of _Robin Hood_. 

"I see this as an absolute win," exclaimed Bob Iger, Disney's chief executive, "_Robin Hood_ is a cinematic masterpiece and I stand behind gif of it 100%." Some consumers were less than enthused by the glitch, but many, however, simply assumed they were watching exclusive content [seen below] from _The Mandalorian_.
