NEW YORK CITY - As a leading voice in the business community, Boredroom News has covered the journeys of hundreds of startups and have seen a pattern in these stories. Now, we're sharing the five most common pitfalls that have waylaid entrepreneurs on their paths to success, despite the fact that [articles like this](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/) have already been published and we told one member of our team [David Haig] to specifically look at them. 

1.  **Market Need**

More than anything else, startup fails because they don't have a product or service that the market wants to buy. This may seem pretty self-explanatory, but when we assigned market research to a certain member of our team, he assured us that "of course millions of people want to read sophomoric satire about [options trading](https://www.boredroomnews.com/general/finance/2019/07/08/epstein.html) littered with [esoteric references](https://www.boredroomnews.com/general/opinion/2019/06/09/lyndon.html)."

2.  **Lack of Funds**

It doesn't take a top MBA to know that companies need cash to keep the website up and running, but those invoices were supposed to go out *two weeks ago*, but I have no idea what Dave thought he should be doing instead.

3.  **Mis-aligned Marketing**

Find the right channels for your audience early; e.g. an internet satire publication needs a strong Twitter presence, not the brilliant idea of a giant billboard on the 405. 

4.  **No Internal Processes**

It can be hard to do everything for the first time, but *somebody* had to check on whether the printer changed the logo on the new t-shirts, and guess who's assigned to that in Trello?

5.  **Unclear Priorities**

Keeping a simple Excel sheet of expenses shouldn't be that hard, but apparently it is for that fucktard, Dave.

To prevent these common obstacles, Entrepreneurs must continuously re-evaluate their teams and maybe either get Dave's ass in gear or out the door.
