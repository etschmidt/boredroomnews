PARMA, ITALY - Guido Barilla, the outspoken chairman of one of the market's leading pasta manufacturers, is in hot water once again for his [views on LGBT issues](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barilla-pasta-anti-gay_n_3995679). Effective this week, the company will shift focus to more family-friendly shapes like rigatoni, penne, and regular-thickness spaghetti - the core of it's 'straight-only' policy. 

"Barilla wholeheartedly embraces its traditional European values," announced the chairman, "and therefore cease all production of farfalle, commonly known as bow-tie or butterfly pasta." Mr. Barilla suggested that consumers who wish to purchase such 'abhorrent' shapes would be better served by "those tortellini-folders over at Trader Joe's"
