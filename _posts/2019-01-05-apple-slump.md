SHENZHEN, CHINA - As Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/)) posts disappointing revenue projections for the coming year, mainly due to [slower sales in China](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/apple-revenue-decline-china.html), analysts at the company have been scrambling to pinpoint exact causes. Corporate strategists have recently uncovered that hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers who are not paid a living wage cannot afford the expensive iPhones that they themselves assemble.

CEO Tim Cook has turned Apple Eastward in the eight years since he took the helm of the company, hoping that emerging markets in Asia will sustain growth after Western markets become saturated. However, Mr. Cook is relying on a potential customer base comprised heavily of laborers tied into Apple's  deep supply chain.
