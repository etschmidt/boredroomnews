Do you shit millenial pink? Do you say that "braod city" is you spirit animal but live in a Chelsea condo that your finance on Wall street owns? Then I've got the post-hipster wellness brand-that's actually cheap CPG startup for you!

Do you own everything from Goop that comes in rose Gold?

Things are better because they're more expansive; that's plain science.

A label so conspicuous that your frenemies know you paid $11 a bottle, but plain so you can feign modesty about it.

Make others prove their own coolness to you by making them ask what flavor collaboration you're carrying today.

Intentional about being casually sexy

Femininity empowered enough to read Plath by the pool in the hamptons, but as long you you show enough skin.

The high-waisted shorts side of normcore hipster fashionista

chic enough to be the kind of rebellious youth that private school teens in Weschester imagine living in the East Village is like

young, wild, and carefree, but only as long as their parents are still paying for the apartment in Williamsburg

Absolutely guaranteed returns for the next 8 months or until taylor Swift is caught on camera throwing a bottle into the east river.
