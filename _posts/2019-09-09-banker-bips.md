ANN ARBOR, MI - Former [Citigroup](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/C/) Summer Analyst, Dylan Hartigan, returned to campus this week after receiving a full-time offer of employment after graduation. By referring to all numbers in basis points, regardless of context, Mr. Hartigan has impressed his fellow undergraduate classmates at the Ross School of Business with his vast array of financial knowledge and experience, gleaned from all ten weeks of his summer program. Clad in his branded [Columbia high-finance vest](https://www.boredroomnews.com/finance/2019/04/04/vest-finance.html), Hartigan can be found around campus putting his internship skills to good use, knowing that a grande latte at Starbucks is exactly four thousand fifteen hundred bips.
