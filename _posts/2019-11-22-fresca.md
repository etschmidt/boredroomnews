TIANJIN PROVINCE - President Trump's trade war with the world's most populist country may have some U.S. firms and investors wary of the future, but for Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), their outlook has never been fresher. 

Geologists, funded by the beverage conglomerate, found deep underwater lakes brimming with the lime- and grapefruit-flavored diet soda, which Coco-Cola executives are eager to extract. The wellspring is believed to be enough raw, carbonated Fresca to satisfy the market needs of the coming decade as consumers shift their preferences to natural beverages. Like the boom in flavored waters, teas, and other low-calorie drinks, Fresca comes from the ground with zero sugars and a host of bold citrus zest.
