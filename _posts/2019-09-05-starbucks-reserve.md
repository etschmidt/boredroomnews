SEATTLE - The coffee chain [Starbucks](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX/) has issued emergency call up orders to hundreds of Reserve battalions in light of a new cold brew and ethically-sourced push by various small-batch roaster across America. Chief Executive Kevin Johnson has given the these Reservists complete autonomy to  utilize whatever brewing methods they deem necessary to launch a bold, earthy counter-offensive.

A Starbucks' spokeSperson said intelligence assessments called for the deployment of barista reserves; last August’s infiltration of previously-ungentrified neighborhoods from Greenpoint, Brooklyn to Inglewood, L.A., by single-origin, shade-grown roasting factions necessitated the additional manpower.

“This signifies that Starbucks regards this third-wave coffee movement as a legitimate threat,” the vice president of marketing and defense, Bill Danberg, said on Tuesday night, "cold-brew options are still on the table."

The various Macha and Boba Tea situations are also in flux, Danberg said, “and Starbucks needs full-bodied response greater than $3 cake pops this time.”

One of the reservists summoned told Boredroom News he hadn’t expected his call-up letter until next year since he was only released from active duty on the front lines last July. The company has [vowed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/starbucks-to-revise-work-scheduling-policies.html) to curb such scheduling practices in the past, but officials have reminded employees that "service to the Empire and minimum wage is reward enough for their sacrifice."
