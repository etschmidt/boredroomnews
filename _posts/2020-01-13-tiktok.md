LOS ANGELES -- According to research by a leading cybersecurity firm, a serious vulnerability has allowed some users of the social media network [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/en/) to view their own deaths at seemingly indeterminate points in the future. Although TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has assured users that these ominous videos have nether [compromised their account](https://nyti.ms/2T4zHfs) nor sealed their eternal fates.

"It looked like all the other vids of me dancing in my bedroom," says Lizzie Davis, 17, a high school student in Encino, said of one such digital premonition, "but then my bookcase fell and just crushed me," leaving her body pinned underneath until it went limp as Nikki Minaj echoed in the background. When she complained to the company, Ms. Davis was told that she is not doomed to suffer such a horrific destiny and that the responsible code errors have been patched. 

Nevertheless, some users are still wary about using the app after they say some deaths have come to fruition. "I thought what Ronnie showed me was a joke," says Jim Wyman, whose late husband was decapitated by an errant ski two weeks ago, "but when we were in Lake Tahoe -- Bam! Ski to the neck; just like in the video." Mr. Wyman believes that the death was much more than a freak accident and is pursuing legal action against TikTok as well as its Beijing-based parent company.

In a press release on Monday, TikTok assured investors that the bugs affected a "limited number" of users and that the company was "definitely not cursed by an unknown, arcane malice beyond human comprehension."

"In fact, most accounts flagged by an internal review showed no deaths at all, only mindless blackness set to Lil Yachty on an inescapable loop."
