LOS GATOS, CA -- The streaming giant revealed that it has amended some episodes of its hit show _Stranger Things_ to remove unfavorable references to the Upside Down, according to the company's first [report](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_downloads/2020/02/0220_Netflix_EnvironmentalSocialGovernanceReport_FINAL.pdf_) on Environmental
Social Governance. Although Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nflx/)) has removed content at the demand of governments around the world, this is the first takedown request on behalf of an interdimentional evil super-organism.

The company assures American viewers, and all inhabitants of Earth's natural realm, that the revised episodes will only air within the Upside Down, a parallel, toxic world to our own controlled by an Eldritch hive-mind. â€œWe strongly support artistic freedom worldwide," said Debra Marvin, director of revisions and censorship at Netflix, "and only certain references to unutterable horrors spewing forth to destroy humanity have been altered to comply with valid legal requests from the Mind Flayer's representatives." Upside Down sovereign law, which prohibits producing or possessing materials that "unfavorably portray its unmentionable horrors," has been criticized by various human rights groups. 

When asked for comment, Matt and Ross Duffer, creators and showrunners of _Stranger Things_, noted "It is a shame that Netflix has kowtowed to the whims of such loathsome evils," especially considering the close ties Netflix has with Hawkins National Laboratory, a known subsidiary of the Upside Down, "but it's not like demogorgons are straight up [murdering](https://time.com/5475109/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-audio-last-words/) anyone."
