MINNEAPOLIS, MN - The summer blockbuster has evolved into the the summer binge-watch, and retail giant Target ([TGT](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:TGT)) is pivoting from purveyor of cheap plastic towel racks to one of host of new platforms developing streaming content this year. Just like [Apple TV+](https://www.apple.com/tv/), [CBS All-Access](https://www.cbs.com/all-access/), and the House of Mouse's massive [DisneyPlus](https://preview.disneyplus.com/), Target will be leveraging its existing assets to fill streamers' increasing appetites. 

The platform dubbed "Target+" will provide thousands of hours of unaltered security cameras footage from Target retail stores across America. 


Drama- mother daughter fighting in aisle
Comedy - fat guy trying on misshapen khakis
Food + pizza hut express, slow-cooked breadsticks
After dark - bathroom

Executives hope to re-introduce the brand to customers who previously only entered the store to pick up off-brand candy to sneak into the movie theater next door in the mall. Media critics remain skeptical, as a similar product developed by [Walmart](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WMT), the mystery-drama "Who Shat in Aisle 6?", was received relatively poorly.
