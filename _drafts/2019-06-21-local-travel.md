These people are a picture-perfect example of why local travel agencies aren't an industry anymore; not only was their customer service unpleasant and talking to Jeannie was like trying to teach a dog calculus, but they weren't even cheaper than googling the information myself and paying sticker prices advertised on the hotel's websites.

Unfortunately, I was made to use them for a large party to go to Mexico; a pretty easy endeavor. For some reason, the price of our shared hotel was inextricable dependent on from where (not even when) we were flying from. Now, I say "price of the hotel" but it was really "what Jeannie says the price was" because just going to the hotel's website and booking the room ourselves was a cheaper and easier option, especially since I didn't have to deal with someone like Jeannie. When I informed them of this fact, the perceived incredulity that anyone else could find the same routes and prices that they had, even in less than the 48 hours it took them to do so, was both fascinating and disgusting. 

They've been in business quite a while (certainly their so-terrible-that-it's-be-genius-were-it-ironic website speaks to it) but maybe it's time they moved on. Thirty years ago, sure, they could've gotten away with these antics because what were customers going to do? call every airline and hotel in and out of mexico? But now the fact that they try to pass off what they're doing as anything other than taking a lot longer to google search something and then rudely was me to pay them would be criminal if anyone actually took this industry seriously anymore. I suggest that they move into something a little more relevant to the times, like typewriter repair or telegraph operator
