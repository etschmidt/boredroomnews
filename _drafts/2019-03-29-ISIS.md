UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, UPPER MANHATTAN - A harrowing story, but, unfortunately, an all-to-familiar one: a bright, young man descends into an online world that warps his mind and then travels across the globe to fight for a cause he barely understands, injuring friends, family, and his community along the way. 

The day that Bobby Caldwell, 27, of Appleton, WI, left home for good he packed light: a pair of slacks, an Oxford-cut button-down, new Ferragamos that he saw in a video once. He also had his Thinkpad and an unbranded Patagonia vest for those chilly Midtown mornings; everything else, he had been told would be provided once he arrived at his ultimate destination, the International School for Investment Studies. 

ISIS, as the school is commonly known, is part of an elite Ivy-League business school, a breeding-ground for radical-capitalist thought, churning out bankers every spring to do economic violence against the common man. 



Whose father was a staunch trade-unionist and mother was a public school teacher. 


studied anthropology at Wesleyan, then four years in marketing at an e-commerce startup. dabbled in index funds but never anything as serious as options trading or high finance. 


radicalized by poets and quants, who then sold his information to capitalist recruiters. a brief information session got him hooked on finance. after being lead on by recuruiters for months, he was fianlly ready to brave the trek accross the Hudson to ISIS

He asked about the core curriculum and whether ISIS follows Libertarian Capitalism. “I am not familiar with Milton Friedman,” he allegedly told the recruiter. “I am excited about coming … but I feel I won’t know what all I will be doing.”

Well, some people have called me a monster, a pariah, but I’d say that I’m an activist short seller. I don’t know chuckles quite a few. I guess right now you I don’t even see them as companies anymore, just blips on a screen. And when I want to make some more money, and I always want to make some more money, I just make up some research and shoot them down. Then *poof* no more company.
 
I know that Adam Smith will reward me in heaven



Well, I first became interested in capitalistic extremism during an internship at Wells Fargo selling unsuitable financial products to people who would never afford them with their next 1,000 paychecks; also, I really hate poor people
